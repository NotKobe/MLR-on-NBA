abstract = {The aim of this paper is to develop Cook's distance measures for assessing the influence of both atypical curves and observations under varying coefficient model for functional responses. Our Cook's distance measures include Cook's distances for deleting multiple curves and for deleting multiple grid points, and their scaled Cook's distances. We systematically investigate some theoretical properties of these diagnostic measures. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample properties of these Cook's distances under different scenarios. A real diffusion tensor tract data set is analyzed to illustrate the use of our diagnostic measures.},

abstract = {This book shows you how to make UX design decisions based on data-not hunches. The authors recognize the enormous potential of user data that is collected as a natural by-product of routine UX research methods, including moderated usability tests, unmoderated usability tests, surveys, and contextual inquiries. They explain how to utilize both descriptive and predictive statistical techniques to gain meaningful insight with that data. By mastering the use of these techniques, you'll delight your users, increase your bottom line and gain a powerful competitive advantage for your company-and yourself. --},
